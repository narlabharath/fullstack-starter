# 🧠 Kickoff Template — How to Start Your App Idea

This template helps you (or your collaborators, or ChatGPT) quickly explain what kind of app you want to build using this fullstack-starter platform.

Just fill in the blanks or use the sample at the bottom 👇

---

## ✍️ Copy-Paste and Fill:

> I'm using the `fullstack-starter` base (Flask + React + Tailwind in Codespaces).

> I want to build a [short one-liner about your app idea].

---

## 🔹 What should the frontend have?

> It should have:
> - [Input box / dropdown / form / list / toggle / button]
> - [Optional: user authentication, file upload, etc.]

---

## 🔹 What should Flask (backend) do?

> Flask should:
> - [Accept input from the frontend]
> - [Return a message / list / transformed data / AI response / validation]
> - [Optionally: store anything? in memory? database later?]

---

## 🔹 Data behavior

> For now:
> - [Just in memory / Not saving anything yet / Will add DB later]

---

## 🎨 Style (optional)

> I'd like the style to feel:
> - [Minimal / cozy / elegant / modern / neon / iOS-like / dark]

---

## 💬 Sample Brief:

> I'm using `fullstack-starter`. I want to build a "random fact generator."  
> The frontend should have a dropdown to pick a category and a button to generate a fact.  
> Flask should return a random fact based on the category.  
> No database needed, just return from a list of pre-written facts.  
> Style should be fun and colorful with emoji.

---

## 🔁 Keep it Simple

You don’t have to overthink the brief — just describe what you want and what it should do.  
This template helps you keep the flow going instead of getting stuck.
